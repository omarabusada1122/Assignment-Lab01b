# Mindset

### Growth Mindset

###### A growth mindset means that you believe your intelligence and talents can be developed over time.


### Fixed Mindset 

###### A fixed mindset means that you believe intelligence is fixed—so if you’re not good at something, you might believe you’ll never be good at it.   
  
### Strategies to Develop Growth Mindset:
- Acknowledge and embrace your weaknesses.
- View challenges as opportunities.
- Know your learning style and use the right learning strategies.
-  Remember that the brain has the ability to change throughout life.
-  Prioritize learning over seeking approval.
